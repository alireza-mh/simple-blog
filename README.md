# simple Blog with Reactjs
This is simple blog website with SPA approach. You can find theme that have been used on Design folder(will be added soon).
since this is only front-end boilerplate i mocked some api and add component functionality on top of them.
bootstrap styling has been added and also since we use bootstrap we used reactstrap which is UI kit based on bootstrap.
## Run Blog
`yarn intall`

then 

`yarn start`

project will be run at port 3000.
any contribution are welcome
